### House Price Preditcion

Predicting house prices for those sold in King County, WA in the years 2014 and 2015. This was my second capstone project for my Data Science certificate with Great Learning and University of Texas at Austin. I experimented with multiple regressors including OLS Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forests, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, and XGBoost and opted for the XGBoost regressor that had a R-square value 0f 0.81 and a RMSE value of 157,407 on the test data set. I am still unsatisfied with these results and plan to use GPS coordinates to estimate the distance to the nearest hospital, school, fire department, etc. for each house. I consider this project to still be a work in progress.

### Customer Churn

Predicting which customers of an insurance company are likely to default on the premium renewal. This was my first capstone project for my Data Science certificate with Great Learning and University of Texas at Austin. For this project, I experimented with multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forests, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, and XGBoost. I opted for the Logistic Regression that had the best AUC value of 0.78 and Recall value of 65.2% on the test data set.

### Differences-in-Differences

My replication of [***Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania***](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf) by David Card and Alan B. Krueger (1994). I replicated this paper to display my understanding of exploiting quasi-experiments to measure treatment effect of a policy change when random assignment is not possible, but treatment is applied to one selected group but not another who typically move in parallel.

### Regression Discontinuity Design

My replication of [***The Minimum Legal Drinking Age and Crime***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4477871/#SD1) by Christopher Carpenter and Carlos Dobkin (2015 ). This replication showcases my understanding of the potential for regression discontinuity design to estimate causal impact when randomized assignment is not possible, but a discontinuous trend occurs along an otherwise smooth variable of interest where a cutoff is imposed to determine treatment of a individual or group.
